namedtuple2
===========

A minimal implementation of tuple with named fields.

Motivation
----------

I think the implementation of `namedtuple` (included in `collections` in The Python Standard Library) is a little bit complicated, so there is a minimal (maybe trivial) alternative.

Documentation
-------------

The code is well commented, see `namedtuple2.py` directly.
